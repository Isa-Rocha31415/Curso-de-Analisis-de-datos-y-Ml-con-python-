Si ordenas por más de una columna, Pandas primero ordenará por la primera columna indicada, luego dentro de esos resultados, ordenará por la siguiente columna, y así sucesivamente.\n","\n","2. **axis:** Determina si ordenarás por filas o por columnas. Por defecto es `0`, lo que significa que ordena las filas. Si se establece en `1`, ordenará las columnas.\n","\n","3. **ascending:** Un booleano o una lista de booleanos que indica si el ordenamiento debe ser ascendente (`True`) o descendente (`False`). Si `by` especifica más de una columna y `ascending` es una lista, cada booleano en la lista corresponderá a cada columna en `by`.\n","\n","4. **inplace:** Si se establece en `True`, el ordenamiento se aplicará en el DataFrame original, modificándolo. Si es `False` (por defecto), Pandas devolverá una nueva instancia del DataFrame ordenado, dejando el original sin cambios.\n","\n","5. **kind:** Especifica el algoritmo de ordenamiento a usar. Las opciones incluyen `quicksort` (por defecto), `mergesort`, `heapsort`, etc. Cada algoritmo tiene sus propias características en términos de rendimiento y estabilidad (si mantiene el orden relativo de los elementos iguales).\n","\n","6. **na_position:** Indica dónde deben colocarse los valores `NaN`. Las opciones son `'first'` para colocar `NaN` al principio o `'last'` (por defecto) para colocarlos al final.\n","\n","7. **ignore_index:** Si se establece en `True`, el índice del DataFrame se ignorará durante el ordenamiento y se generará un nuevo índice de 0 a N-1. Esto puede ser útil si el índice original ya no tiene relevancia después de ordenar los datos.\n","\n","Por ejemplo, si tienes un DataFrame `df` y quieres ordenarlo por la columna `'edad'` de manera descendente y decidir que los valores `NaN` aparezcan al principio, podrías escribir:\n","\n","```python\n","df.sort_values(by='edad', ascending=False, na_position='first')\n","```\n","\n","Estos parámetros te dan mucha flexibilidad para ordenar tus datos de la manera que necesites."],"metadata":{"id":"uclWvitM-KV8"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["El parámetro `ascending` en `sort_values` determina el orden en el que se ordenan los valores de la columna especificada:\n","\n","1. **`ascending=True`:**\n","   - Cuando configuras `ascending=True`, estás indicando que quieres ordenar los datos en orden ascendente.\n","   - Esto significa que los valores más pequeños o más antiguos aparecerán primero.\n","   - Por ejemplo, si estás ordenando fechas con `ascending=True`, las fechas más antiguas aparecerán al principio de tu DataFrame.\n","\n","2. **`ascending=False`:**\n","   - Al configurar `ascending=False`, los datos se ordenarán en orden descendente.\n","   - Esto significa que los valores más grandes o más recientes aparecerán primero.\n","   - Por ejemplo, al ordenar fechas con `ascending=False`, las fechas más recientes estarán al principio del DataFrame.\n","\n","En el contexto de tu ejemplo, `df.sort_values('published_date.numberLong', ascending=True)` ordenará el DataFrame `df` basado en la columna `'published_date.numberLong'` en orden ascendente.
